This was a practice project using fictional client data consisting of client ID's, locations, multiple survey responses, and various details stored as string data. 
This project used Microsoft Excel to clean and shape/manipulate the data into a usable form within Visual Studio Code and Python.
In Excel, the double row of headers were combined into a single row using functions.
Using Python, the Excel sheets were imported, excess columns were deleted, data table was pivoted using the melt method in pandas, client answers were combined, and data was grouped by individual questions and responses based on the fictional survey.
Data was transformed and cleaned, going from a table with 99 columns and 200 rows to 13 columns and 17029 rows.
